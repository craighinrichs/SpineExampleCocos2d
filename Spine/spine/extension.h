/*
 Implementation notes:

 - An OOP style is used where each "class" is made up of a struct and a number of functions prefixed with the struct name.

 - struct fields that are const are readonly. Either they are set in a constructor and can never be changed, or they can only be
 changed by calling a function.

 - Inheritance is done using a struct field named "super" as the first field, allowing the struct to be cast to its "super class".

 - Classes intended for inheritance provide init/deinit functions which subclasses must call in their create/dispose functions.

 - Polymorphism is done by a base class providing a "vtable" pointer to a struct containing function pointers. The public API
 delegates to the appropriate vtable function. Subclasses may change the vtable pointers.

 - Subclasses do not provide a dispose function, instead the base class' dispose function should be used, which will delegate to
 a dispose function in its vtable.

 - Classes not designed for inheritance cannot be extended. They may use an internal subclass to hide private data and don't
 expose a vtable.

 - The public API hides implementation details such as vtable structs and init/deinit functions. An internal API is exposed in
 extension.h to allow classes to be extended. Internal structs and functions begin with underscore (_).

 - OOP in C tends to lose type safety. Macros are provided in extension.h to give context for why a cast is being done.
